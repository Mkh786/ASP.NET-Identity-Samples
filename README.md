# ASP.NET-Identity-Samples
ASP.NET Identity samples including oAuth, two factor, migrating, and more

These demos go with the course here
  http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/customizing-asp-net-authentication-with-identity
  (although you don't have to watch that to get something out of it)
  
In each project, I've kept the same namespace and created them all from "BasicTemplate - 1a No auth at all - Use this to diff other projects"
So you can use a tool like BeyondCompare to diff each project and see the changes.

In each project, there's a "README - DIRECTIONS.txt" file. That contains the directions to go from a new MVC projects to the desired goal for that particular project.

Feel free to hit me up with any questions adamt at microsoft.

At this point, two projects need to be finished up (which I'll do shortly)
  BasicTemplate - Individual with custom user key (int instead of string)
